Kickstarter projects are startups that many shareholders invest in. Oftentimes, it is not known whether or not the project will fail. Machine Learning can help develop models that can predict whether or not the startup will fail. This project will focus on models created using logistic regression, ensemble, and support vector machine algorithms. The team consisted of Ali Fayed (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-fayed-ab7784325/), Akshat Singh (https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshat-singh-losgatos/), and Ahmed Sabzwari (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-sabzwari-4670b8263/)
